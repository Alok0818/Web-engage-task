Subject: Request for Extension on Delivery Date for Task.

Dear Account Manager,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to meet the original delivery date for the task due to a family emergency. I understand the importance of meeting the deadlines and I am truly sorry for any inconvenience this might cause.

Given the circumstances, I would like to request an extension of three days. I assure you that I will make every effort to complete the task as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alokkumar Kushwaha
